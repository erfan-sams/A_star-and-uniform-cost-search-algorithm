# Astar-and-uniform-cost-search-algorithm

implement uniform cost search and A* search for find solution in matrix environment

we have a 30x30 matrix and start cell and final cell, some cell is blocked we should find the shortest path from start to final cell and return it.
"default algorithm is ucs"
